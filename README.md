This is a small demo of a javascript based simplistic terminal emulator.

See [the demo in action](https://elad661.github.io/javascript_terminal_demo/).

It doesn't have all the features a regular terminal has, but it's enough
to get you started if you want to build a web-based terminal-styled REPL.

It is inspired by "[unixkcd](https://github.com/chromakode/xkcdfools)", but
no code was copied. While unixkcd features a more complete implementation
that is easy to use, my example **supports mobile browsers**, does not require JQuery,
and uses CSS animations for blinking the caret.

There are many examples like this one across the web, but a lot of them are
old, buggy, or incomplete - so I just made my own.
